# Useful Scripts

Storing scripts written for everyday software that I've found helpful.

## Raycast

[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) is a macOS app that acts as a Spotlight replacement. There are a few scripts I've written for it that I've found helpful.

#### Mutify

This script will mute Spotify ads while it's running. It's a great way to listen to music without distractions.

#### New Project

This script will create a new project folder from a set template.

#### YT-DLP

An easy front end for yt-dlp. Requires yt-dlp to be installed.

## After Effects

#### Project Compactor

This is designed for editor using AE files in a modular way. It combines 'Reduce Project' and 'Consolidate Footage' into one script, and also adds the ability to consolidate nulls, solids, and duplicate compositions. Helpful for packaging up a project for sending to a 3rd party or for localisation.
